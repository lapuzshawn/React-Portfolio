    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to my portfolio! I'm a web developer with a passion for creating amazing user experiences. 
      I have expertise in front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I enjoy working 
      with modern frameworks like React.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe in clean and elegant code that is easy to maintain and understand. I'm always eager to 
      learn new technologies and expand my skill set to stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the outdoors, reading a good book, or experimenting 
      with new recipes in the kitchen. Feel free to browse through my portfolio and get in touch if you 
      have any questions or project ideas!
