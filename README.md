# 20 React: React Portfolio

## Description

Welcome to my vibrant web development portfolio! 
As a web developer, I believe in embracing the power of community and showcasing my skills through the colorful world of React.

Inside this virtual hub, you'll discover three pages: "About Me," "My Projects," and a handy "Contact Me" section. 
(Just a heads-up, I've decided to keep my resume page hush-hush for privacy reasons. Gotta protect those top-secret skills, you know?)

If you're curious about my public links, you can find them gracefully lounging in the footer. 
Feel free to slide into my LinkedIn DMs! Let's connect and make some web magic together.

What are you waiting for? Dive in and explore!
